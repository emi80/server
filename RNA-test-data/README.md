# RNA API test dataset

`encodeEvaluation2ga.py` is a simple script to convert a subset of the ENCODE evaluation dataset to a format suitable for testing the RNA API implementation for the GA4GH reference server.

The script will take care of downloading a tarball containing the data and converting it. Just run it as follows to get the results in your currnet folder

```shell
 ./encodeEvaluation2ga.py 
```

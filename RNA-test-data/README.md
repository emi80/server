# RNA API test dataset

`encodeEvaluation2ga.py` is a simple script to convert a subset of the ENCODE evaluation dataset to a format suitable for testing the RNA API implementation for the GA4GH reference server.

The script will take care of downloading the data tarball and extract the required data from there. Just run it as follows to get the results in your currnet folder:

```shell
 ./encodeEvaluation2ga.py 
```
